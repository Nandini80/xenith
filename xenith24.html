            In the past few years we have grown to realise that technology is
            the fuel that can drive the simplest of ventures to wondrous
            heights. With new things coming up every now and then, we often
            wonder the depth of innovation and ideation that we are surrounded
            with and are curious to learn and explore more about this abyss and
            “Pursuit the Abyss” with passion and motivation, hoping to uncover
            some pearls of knowledge. To make this quest for learning more
            interesting and to help you reach the “zenith” of your abilities,
            IEEE Student Branch of JIIT Noida,is back with its flagship event,
            Xenith’23 - Pursuit of Abyss. Xenith is IEEE JIIT’s flagship event,
            an annually organised technical fest when the entire campus comes
            alive to the exciting theme and buzzes with a plethora of events
            giving students an opportunity to try their hands at various new
            challenges and develop new skills as well as cultivate confidence
            and build as a team player. This year, Xenith gets bigger and better
            as it pushes you to dive into the unknown and seek more than what
            meets the eye. Its all about exploring yourself while you pursuit
            the abyss! Tighten your safety jackets, hold your breaths and dive
            in!
